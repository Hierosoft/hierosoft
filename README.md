# hierosoft
Solve the Python distribution dilemma by managing virtualenvs and copies of Python. The gui_tk main function should be launched by the icon. In Windows, this should be compiled as an exe. If the hierosoft module detects a Python copy of itself in appdata, it will try to run that instead of itself. Core features: It is the python manager and virtualenv manager module that downloads and runs the main program. Planned features: Download and run itself (updated Python copy) as the main program which should run the launcher (eventually the process of installing apps should move to the launcher which should use the downloaded python version of this module).
